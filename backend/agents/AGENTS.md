For the backend architecture and design patterns:
@./CLAUDE.md

Critical agent protocol rules for future work:

- `lead_agent` is an explicit built-in agent and a reserved name.
- Missing runtime `agent_name` should normalize to `lead_agent`, not to a special `None` branch.
- `dev` and `prod` are archive versions only, not runtime mode switches.
- Runtime local vs sandbox selection belongs to Python startup/config only.
- Shared skills live in `skills/{public,custom}/`.
- Agent-owned copies live in `agents/{status}/{name}/skills/`.
- Agent-owned prompt lives in `agents/{status}/{name}/AGENTS.md`.
- `lead_agent` also uses `agents/{status}/lead_agent/AGENTS.md` and `agents/{status}/lead_agent/skills/` like every other agent.
- Go/Gateway owns CRUD, publish, DB persistence, and local archive writes.
- Python runtime owns backend selection, runtime seeding, and execution.
- Runtime must read from thread-local copies under `/mnt/user-data/...`, not directly mutate archived files.
- Open API should resolve `prod` agents only.

When extending the protocol, including dependency-style extensions:

- Add new agent-owned assets under `agents/{status}/{name}/...`.
- Materialize/copy them during create, update, and publish.
- Seed them into `/mnt/user-data/...` during Python runtime startup.
- Keep local and sandbox runtimes on the same virtual path contract.
- Do not put runtime backend choice into Go APIs, DB config, or agent manifests.
